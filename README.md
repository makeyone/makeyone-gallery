# Makeyone Gallery

**Makeone** is a platform for easy and systematic recording of custom keyboard build processes.
Users can register how they have assembled their own keyboards and conveniently check other users builds.
In addition, you can check the keycap and switch information for each keyboard layout, so you can refer to various builds.
